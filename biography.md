---

James Garner is a composer whose music has been described as “utterly accomplished in all respects” (Dame Judith Weir) and praised for its “warmth, sincerity and tension” (Bachtrack). His works have been performed in the UK and internationally.

James has a deep affinity for vocal and theatrical music, having written multiple works for the stage. In 2017, his first chamber opera, _East o' the Sun, West o' the Moon_, received its North American premiere in Montreal, and in 2020 he collaborated on The Opera Story’s digital series _Episodes_, which won an RPS Inspiration Award. He has previously been commissioned by English Touring Opera (for whom he wrote his second opera, _Dust Child_), The Opera Story, and Tête à Tête. His next major work and first full-length opera, _Much Ado_, is based on Shakespeare’s original play and was previewed for the Association for Opera in Canada. It is commissioned by Opera McGill, who will give its world premiere in 2026/27 at the Monument-National in Montréal.

James’s music has also been performed at festivals and series, including the Kings Place Festival, Richmond Concert Series, and Borough New Music. Much of his recent output has consisted of solo and chamber music, including a new work for the guitarist George Tarlton, and a chamber commission from the Orchestra of Opera North. In 2024, he curated a programme of newly written music at the historic Old Church Stoke Newington, in collaboration with Owen Spafford, Alex Lyon, Hania Woźniak and Carla Huhtanen. Future projects include a song cycle for the soprano Elisabeth Boudreault, and a new collection of solo piano pieces for Joseph Havlat.

James is in regular demand in the UK as a composer for participatory and outreach projects. He has mentored students at the RAM, RCM, Guildhall School and Oxford University in music facilitation and opera-making. He has also worked as a conductor and music assistant for the Barbican Centre, Royal Opera House, Royal Festival Hall and BBC Four. He is a regular guest artist on McGill University’s opera programme.

Currently, James is composing a film opera with the Canadian novelist Lisa Moore for Opera on the Avalon’s New Commission Series, and leading a participatory project at the V&A Museum.

James graduated from the Guildhall School with the Muriel Dawson/Mary Ryan Award for Composition. He is also a recent graduate from the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied with David Sawer and additionally with Hans Abrahamsen, supported by the Munster Trust. Previously, James was co-founder and music director of workshOPERA, who were nominated for a New British Music Theatre Award in 2016.

His work has been generously supported by the Arts Council and the Maria Björnson Fund.\
